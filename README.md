This is a template project you can use as a base for your own BlueMap Native Addon!

This is a Native BlueMap Addon, so it should be compatible with
all platforms and all versions that BlueMap supports, including the CLI!\
Just put the `.jar` file in the `addons/` directory, and it should work out of the box.

To reload this addon, just reload BlueMap itself with `/bluemap reload`.
