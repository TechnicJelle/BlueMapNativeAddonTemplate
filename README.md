This is a template project you can use as a base for your own BlueMap Native Addon!

This is a Native BlueMap Addon, so it should be compatible with
all platforms and all versions that BlueMap supports, including the CLI!\
Just put the `.jar` file in BlueMap's `packs/` directory, and it should work out of the box.

The config file(s) for this addon are where configs normally are on your platform. (So *next to* BlueMap's own config folder.)

To reload this addon, just reload BlueMap itself with `/bluemap reload`.

## Other templates

For a template that uses Gradle instead of Maven and that has less stuff out of the box, feel free to use [this other template by Blue](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/AddonTemplate).  
(**Tip:** Try mixing and matching files from both templates to make something that does exactly what you want!)
